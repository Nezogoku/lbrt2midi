        seems to be quarter notes

Segment changes 0x04
    Event ID (When sequence hops to the next segment) 0x00

EVENT 0x1C
    Event ID (0x00 is Start and End of track) 0x00
    Delta time 0x04
    Event Value Tempo (Likely corresponding to tempo change) 0x08
        Microseconds per quarter note
        Tempo = 60000000/MPQn
        Likely treated like duration for non loop events?

    Event value Type (Likely corresponding to event type) 0x12
        Meta and channel events (not including note on/off I guess)
        
    Event value 0 (Likely corresponding to event value 1) 0x14
        Note on/off velocity?
        
    Event value 1 (Likely corresponding to event value 2) 0x16
        Might correspond to panning of note on/off event
        
    Event value X (Likely corresponding to event value X) 0x18
        Channel events only maybe?
