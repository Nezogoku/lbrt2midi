# lbrt2midi
Converts sequence files from Patapon 1 and 2 to playable midi files and readable csv files.
Additionally takes SGD files and converts them to SF2 files (currently mostly works on Patapon SGD files).

Requires gocha's SF2cute library to build.

Borrowed code from John Walker (csvmidi) and jmarti856 (decode) with some minor changes.

Heavily inspired by owocek's LBRTPlayer.
